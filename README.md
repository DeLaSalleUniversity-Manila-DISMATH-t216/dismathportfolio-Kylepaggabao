###Week 1
* I learned the basic concepts of dismath

* I learned that a proposition is a statement that is either true or false

* I learned how to understand the Truth table of different Logical Connectives

* I learned new symbols like ∧ for conjunction, ∨ for disjunction, ⊕ for exclusive or, → for conditional and ↔ for biconditional

###Week 2
* Logical Equivalences have 10 laws which are:

       * Identity Laws

       * Domination Laws

       * Negation Laws

       * Double Negation Law

       * Idempotent Laws

       * Commutative Laws

       * Associative Laws

       * Distributive Laws

       * De Morgan's Laws

       * Absorption Laws

* I learned about the different Rules of Inference:

       * Modus Ponds

       * Modus Tollens
       
       * Hypothetical syllogism

       * Disjunctive syllogism

       * Addition

       * Simplification

       * Conjunction 

       * Resolution

###Week 3
* I learned about the different methods of proof:

       * Direct Proof

       * Proof by Contraposition (Indirect)

       * Vacuous Proof

       * Trivial Proof

       * Proof by Contradiction (Indirect)

       * Proof by Equivalence

###Week 4
* I learned more about the proof by Contradiction (Indirect) and by Equivalences

* I learned how to prove by Mathematical Induction
